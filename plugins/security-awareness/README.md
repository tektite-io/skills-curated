# Security Awareness

Teaches agents to recognize and avoid security threats during normal activity. Covers phishing detection, credential protection, domain verification, and social engineering defense.

## Install

```
/plugin install trailofbits/skills-curated/plugins/security-awareness
```

## What It Covers

- **Threat recognition** — domain verification, social engineering signals, phishing detection
- **Credential handling** — reading before sharing, flagging embedded secrets, domain-matching before login
- **Secret channel discipline** — keeping API keys, tokens, and passwords out of persistent channels
- **Decisiveness** — acting on identified threats rather than hedging
